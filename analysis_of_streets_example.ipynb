    "# Vision-based classification of outdoor environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of this project is to use the Computer Vision models provided by Restb.ai to make vision-based classifications and predictions about natural surroundings and, mainly, urban areas. The problem it tries to solve is the lack of information on the surrounding areas found on the majority of real estate listings. That is, many details are given about the property itself and its features, but there is often a lack of information regarding the features and quality of the surroundings of the property. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the model described here has many different applications outside the real estate field. For example, it could help identify possible improvements of urban areas. Another possible application is the optimization of transport routes (as an example, customers would be much happier to pass through a more natural or \"green\" sorrounding, than one lacking significant natural light)."

    "We can note that some of the features that the model predicts (mainly the significant presence of natural light and the conditions) aren't well-suited enough for exterior surroundings. In both datasets, many of the values of the `condition_score` colum are null (though not all of them, as can be seen in the next cells), and all the rows have `False` as the value that describes the significant presence of natural light, despite being outdoor environments. That gives the opportunity of further improvement of the computer vision model. \n",
